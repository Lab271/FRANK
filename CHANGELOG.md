# Changelog

All notable changes to FRANK. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Phase 2 (Python) releases up to 0.8.0 are tagged in git; its final state is `phase2-final`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-10-22

Phase 3: FRANK rebuilt in Rust on db-core (ADR-016). The Phase 2 Python service moved to `legacy/phase2/`.

### Added

- `frank` server, one binary (`serve`, `token`, `ingest`, `rebuild-iocs`):
  - sightings in a striped db-core Parquet table (hour files sorted by rule and IoC, closed days merged, retention by whole day);
  - IoCs in a db-core row table, one row per IoC per day, indexed on key, day and IP (CIDR lookups);
  - tiered HTTP API: statistics (cells under 3 suppressed below partner), IoC lookup, CIDR range, Parquet file download for partners, including the open hour (`open/current.parquet`);
  - hashed bearer tokens instead of Cognito.
- Anonymisation by schema: a sighting row has no column for an organisation's identity.
- Browser module (`frank-wasm`): a preview of exactly the rows a submission shares, and SQL over the downloaded Parquet files on db-core's column engine.
- Web UI on the Lab271 design system.
- Deployments: `make run`; podman compose with data on a host bind mount and tokens shared with `make run`; OpenTofu for STACKIT (VM, persistent data volume, Caddy TLS).
- `make demo`: 60 synthetic sightings from the last 7 days (documentation addresses only).
- CI: fmt, clippy (native and wasm32), tests, container image.

### Changed

- Blank observable values are skipped instead of refusing the submission (ADR-008).
- UI files are served with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, so a rebuilt WASM module is picked up.

### Removed

- The Phase 2 Python service, Cognito auth, the admin TUI and web GUI, and the management API (kept in `legacy/phase2/`).
